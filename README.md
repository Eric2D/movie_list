		image url, and the video url for the trailer.

To run this program simply double click on information center.

fresh_tomatoes, was forked from adarsh0806 on 7/27/17. fresh_tomatoes was used
to open the movie information from my variable list in a webbrowser.

I have edited fresh_tomatoes to change the title and the background of the
webpage.
